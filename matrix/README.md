# The Matrix

**EXPLAIN THAT NAME:** The Matrix was basically a container. It also likely ran on Docker.

Container related functionality, from daemon to builder to runner.

I am currently bringing this repository together from a variety of tests that I have done over the past six months, so not everything is working.

The `daemon.go` file on its own (including all the plugins) was capable of running my `zsh` container with tty previously as a proof of concept.
