## wrkspc

A dynamically building workspace for people like me, not you.

### Synopsis


Workspace uses container and cluster technology to dynamically build your tried and true
toolset around you on any machine that contains the binary. Nothing else should
be needed to install.


### Options

```
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.wrkspc.yml) (default ".wrkspc.yml")
  -h, --help            help for wrkspc
  -k, --kube            Run in Kubernetes cluster if true (will create one if none exists).
      --viper           use Viper for configuration (default true)
```
