# Hefner Pipes

Third attempt at creating a type that makes concurrency and network distribution transparent to use.

Previously Hefner Pipes where Hefner Pipes that took Hefner Pipes and returned Hefner Pipes and
only required two or three methods to implment as an interface.

It was powerful, because everything could easily become a Hefner Pipe, which meant anything could
send itself to anything, but it got complicated real fast..
